# Lok Sabha Election Analysis

Welcome to the Lok Sabha Election Analysis project! The goal here is to gather data from the Election Commission of India's official results portal (https://results.eci.gov.in) and perform an insightful analysis based on the collected data.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were utilized for this project:
- **Python**: Used for web scraping and data manipulation.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis tool in Python.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for data analysis and visualization.

## Data Scraping

To collect data from the ECI website, a Python script (`scraping_script.py`) was developed using BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML pages. The script navigates through the website, extracts relevant election results data, and stores it for further analysis.

## Key Insights

Based on the analysis of the scraped data, the following key insights were derived:
1. Voter turnout percentage compared to previous Lok Sabha elections.
2. Distribution of seats among major political parties.
3. Analysis of states with the highest and lowest voter turnout.
4. Demographic breakdown of voter turnout (age, gender).
5. Rural vs urban voting patterns and their implications.
6. Impact of prominent issues on election outcomes.
7. Comparison of winning margins across constituencies.
8. Historical trends in voter preferences and party alliances.
9. Analysis of swing states and their electoral significance.
10. Emerging trends in voter behavior and political landscape.

Each insight is backed by data visualizations and analysis results, which are detailed in the `analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project offers a comprehensive analysis of the recent Lok Sabha election data, highlighting significant trends and patterns in voter behavior, political dynamics, and electoral outcomes.
